Hello,

I am Guillem Cucurull and I'm currently studying a Master in Computer Vision in Barcelona.
As you can see in my posts, I'm highly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

You can find me on Github [https://github.com/gcucurull](https://github.com/gcucurull) to see what I'm doing. I also have an [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1738214/gcucurull?tab=profile) where I answer some questions about deep learning and Tensorflow among others.
