Hello,

I am Guillem Cucurull and I'm currently a Research Engineer at Blue Prism, working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
I am interested in Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision and using Graph Neural Networks to exploit relational information. I've recently been playing a bit with Reinforcement Learning too.

You can [find me on Github](https://github.com/gcucurull) to see what I'm doing. I also have an [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1738214/gcucurull?tab=profile) where I answer some questions about deep learning and Tensorflow among others.

You can contact me at gcucurull@gmail.com
