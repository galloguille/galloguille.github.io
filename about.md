Hello,

I am Guillem Cucurull and I'm currently a Research Intern at Element AI in Montreal, working on deep graph neural networks.
I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, and recently I've shifted towards graph neural networks and their applications.

You can [find me on Github](https://github.com/gcucurull) to see what I'm doing. I also have an [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1738214/gcucurull?tab=profile) where I answer some questions about deep learning and Tensorflow among others.

You can contact me at gcucurull@gmail.com
